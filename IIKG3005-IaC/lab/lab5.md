# Lab 5 - Roles and Profiles 

## Lab tutorial

Launch the Puppet learning-VM `Puppet Learning VM 2019.0.2 6.10` in
SkyHiGh (you will find it in Glance, choose a flavor with 2 vcpus)
and do the following quest:

      - Roles and Profiles
      - Hiera
    
    
To access the Quest Guide and get started, enter the learning-VM’s
IP address in your browser’s address bar (be sure to use
`http://<IPADDRESS>` for the Quest Guide, as `https://<IPADDRESS>`
will take you to the Puppet Enterprise console) or see
[Summary](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-quest-guide/blob/master/summary.md)
    
You can log into the learning-VM with ssh as root, but you need to
access the console in Horizon to see the password on the splash page
(make a note of this password).
